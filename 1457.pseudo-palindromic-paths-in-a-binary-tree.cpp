 *
 * Given a binary tree where node values are digits from 1 to 9. A path in the
 * binary tree is said to be pseudo-palindromic if at least one permutation of
 * the node values in the path is a palindrome.
 *
 * Return the number of pseudo-palindromic paths going from the root node to
 * leaf nodes.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [2,3,1,3,1,null,1]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are
 * three paths going from the root node to leaf nodes: the red path [2,3,3],
 * the green path [2,1,1], and the path [2,3,1]. Among these paths only red
 * path and green path are pseudo-palindromic paths since the red path [2,3,3]
 * can be rearranged in [3,2,3] (palindrome) and the green path [2,1,1] can be
 * rearranged in [1,2,1] (palindrome).
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [2,1,1,1,3,null,null,null,null,null,1]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are
 * three paths going from the root node to leaf nodes: the green path [2,1,1],
 * the path [2,1,3,1], and the path [2,1]. Among these paths only the green
 * path is pseudo-palindromic since [2,1,1] can be rearranged in [1,2,1]
 * (palindrome).
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [9]
 * Output: 1
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^5].
 * 1 <= Node.val <= 9
